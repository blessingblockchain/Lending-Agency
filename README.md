# Lending-Agency

First of all, I credit Nikhil for this project. I learned how to build this smart contract from [their repo](https://github.com/anshulshah96/CrowdBank/blob/master/README.md).

This smart contract solves a financial problem: accessing on-chain loans. This smart contract facilitates every important action that should transpire between the lender and borrower. I also included the use case of mortgage as a hedge.

## What I Learned During This Project
- how to reference enums in a struct
- how to map types within structs
- `.length` can only work with arrays. Didn't include a square bracket in a map and expected to get its length, which definitely reverted an error.
- learned that there is a difference between the version of solidity 0.5.0 and 0.8.20. 0.8.20 does not construct a struct with a map
- the use cases of enums and how to reference it in programs
